## FAQ

### What is auto-merge?

Auto-merge enables a pull request to merge automatically when all requirements are met.
These requirements include completing the necessary reviews and passing all required status checks.
With auto-merge, you donâ€™t need to monitor the pull request manually, allowing you to focus on other tasks.

To use auto-merge, it must first be enabled for the repository.
Once enabled, users with write permissions can configure specific pull requests to merge automatically when all requirements are satisfied.

For more information, see:

- [Managing auto-merge for pull requests in your repository][releases]

### Can this action approve a pull request?

No.

This action does not approve pull requests.
If branch protection rules require approval, you must ensure the pull request is approved before using this action.
